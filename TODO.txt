All
- convert to factories instead of having service calls

- IE stuff not working
    - fancy font's not showing (could be proxy)
    - animation delays not delaying -> is animation delay on for IE (could be proxy)
    - font awesome icons not showing (could be proxy)
    - on search button, showing as an edit vs. a pointer (could be proxy issue)
    - tiny mce iconds don't appear (could be proxy)

All 
    - if going from small to large, or large to small, the if blocks (screen widths checker) don't get executed again so need to fix that (about, subportfolio, resume, portflio)
