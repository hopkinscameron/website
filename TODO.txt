Future
- Create an admin page to add a new project (sub Portfolio)

All
- convert to factories instead of having service calls
- follow MEAN 

- IE stuff not working
    - fancy font's not showing (could be proxy)
    - animation delays not delaying -> is animation delay on for IE (could be proxy)
    - font awesome icons not showing (could be proxy)
    - on search button, showing as an edit vs. a pointer (could be proxy issue)
    - tiny mce iconds don't appear (could be proxy)

MOBILE VIEW FIXES 
Sub Portfolio
    - there are some empty "col-md-2" for innerIndex in gameDataColumnsPerRowArray track by $index -> come back to this.. this exist on about page as well
