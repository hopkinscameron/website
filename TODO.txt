Future
- Create an admin page to add a new project (sub Portfolio)
- Ability to updload images for projects and blogs
- change models so that functions are part of the schema, and so I can create a instance of a model (look at how LocalStrategy was set up)
- find out how to chain functions -> something.something.something -> follow mongoose of find.sort.skip.exec and exec be the last

All 

Done

Pending
- make sure the weeks back are in sorted order (for some reason the keys of the weekObj aren't in order)
- after sign up, send a status back rather than an html

Next
- see if I can use lodash to speed up some stuff I might be doing in server stuff
- blog draft put and blog update (put) method takes a very long time
- seperate out admin views/regular views
- fix socket.io to not print so many error on disconnect
- add functionality where trying to add a value that doesn't exist in the model removes it (if object is  { id, password } then if { id, pass } was passed in, it would remove pass)


- IE stuff not working
    - fancy font's not showing (could be proxy)
    - animation delays not delaying -> is animation delay on for IE (could be proxy)
    - font awesome icons not showing (could be proxy)
    - on search button, showing as an edit vs. a pointer (could be proxy issue)
    - tiny mce iconds don't appear (could be proxy)

MOBILE VIEW FIXES 
Sub Portfolio
    - there are some empty "col-md-2" for innerIndex in gameDataColumnsPerRowArray track by $index -> come back to this.. this exist on about page as well

Mongodb test stuff
db.createUser({ user: "<username>", pwd: "<password>", roles: [ { role: "dbAdmin", db: "<db>" } ]})
db.updateUser("<username>", { roles : [ { role: "dbOwner", db: "<db>" } ], pwd: "<password>"})
./mongo --port 27017 -u "<username>" -p "<password>" --authenticationDatabase "<db>"
db.changeUserPassword("<username>", "<newpassword>")
db.updateUser("<username>", { roles : [ { role: "dbOwner", db: "<db>" } ], pwd: "<password>"})
./mongod --auth --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db1
./mongod --auth --port 27017
