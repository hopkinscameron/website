Future
- Create an admin page to add a new project (sub Portfolio)
- Ability to updload images for projects and blogs
- change models so that functions are part of the schema, and so I can create a instance of a model (look at how LocalStrategy was set up)
- find out how to chain functions -> something.something.something -> follow mongoose of find.sort.skip.exec and exec be the last

All 

Done
- removed "loading" folder from core images
- add validation (isBoolean, isEmail) to server side code on req.checkBody()
- see if I can use lodash to speed up some stuff I might be doing in server stuff
- fixed header so it closes on mobile view 
- mobile view on portfolio page is off
- add to dashboard to show overall views
- hides graph when switching between view types
- added i01 project

Pending

Next

- IE stuff not working
    - fancy font's not showing (could be proxy)
    - animation delays not delaying -> is animation delay on for IE (could be proxy)
    - font awesome icons not showing (could be proxy)
    - on search button, showing as an edit vs. a pointer (could be proxy issue)
    - tiny mce iconds don't appear (could be proxy)

MOBILE VIEW FIXES 
Sub Portfolio
    - there are some empty "col-md-2" for innerIndex in gameDataColumnsPerRowArray track by $index -> come back to this.. this exist on about page as well
