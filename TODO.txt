Future

Next
- see if I can use lodash to speed up some stuff I might be doing in server stuff
- blog draft put and blog update (put) method takes a very long time
- seperate out admin views/regular views
- fix socket.io to not print so many error on disconnect


- IE stuff not working
    - fancy font's not showing (could be proxy)
    - animation delays not delaying -> is animation delay on for IE (could be proxy)
    - font awesome icons not showing (could be proxy)
    - on search button, showing as an edit vs. a pointer (could be proxy issue)
    - tiny mce iconds don't appear (could be proxy)

MOBILE VIEW FIXES 
Sub Portfolio
    - there are some empty "col-md-2" for innerIndex in gameDataColumnsPerRowArray track by $index -> come back to this.. this exist on about page as well
