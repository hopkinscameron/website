Future
- Create an admin page to add a new project (sub Portfolio)
- Ability to updload images for projects and blogs

All 

Done
Pending
- 1. getValidationResult() -> fix everywhere to match whats in login.server.controller
- Remove all mongoose mongo references
- Remove all models -> or rename the file to handle all reads/writes/searches/etc.
- Get express working without mongodb
- Get passport working without mongodb

Next
- see if I can use lodash to speed up some stuff I might be doing in server stuff
- blog draft put and blog update (put) method takes a very long time
- seperate out admin views/regular views
- fix socket.io to not print so many error on disconnect
- change models so that functions are part of the schema, and so I can create a instance of a model


- IE stuff not working
    - fancy font's not showing (could be proxy)
    - animation delays not delaying -> is animation delay on for IE (could be proxy)
    - font awesome icons not showing (could be proxy)
    - on search button, showing as an edit vs. a pointer (could be proxy issue)
    - tiny mce iconds don't appear (could be proxy)

MOBILE VIEW FIXES 
Sub Portfolio
    - there are some empty "col-md-2" for innerIndex in gameDataColumnsPerRowArray track by $index -> come back to this.. this exist on about page as well

./mongo --port 27017 -u "<username>" -p "<password>" --authenticationDatabase "<db>"
db.changeUserPassword("<username>", "<newpassword>")
db.updateUser("<username>", { roles : [ { role: "dbOwner", db: "<db>" } ], pwd: "<password>"})
