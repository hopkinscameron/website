Future
- Create an admin page to add a new project (sub Portfolio)

All
- #1 Go back in blog.server.controller to finish api calls -> when getting portfolio or blog by id in server, don't convert to object unless sending it back to user
- Seperate out neccessary api calls (title, blog list, etc.) -> do in header as well so that certain things have it;s own api call on the page
- seperate out the saving/posting a blog in api calls -> basically so that if its a new post, make call to "postNewBlog", "saveNewBlog", "updateDraft", "updateBlog"
- seperate out admin views/regular views
- move passport to config, seperate out express, app, etc.
- see if I have to stringify the data or if I can just do res.json instead
- move json data files under server under the module (fix routes)
- fix passport in login
- move the models into its folders
- in blog controller, see if we can make it to find one and update instead of seperate

- IE stuff not working
    - fancy font's not showing (could be proxy)
    - animation delays not delaying -> is animation delay on for IE (could be proxy)
    - font awesome icons not showing (could be proxy)
    - on search button, showing as an edit vs. a pointer (could be proxy issue)
    - tiny mce iconds don't appear (could be proxy)
