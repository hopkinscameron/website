Future
- Create an admin page to add a new project (sub Portfolio)
- Ability to updload images for projects and blogs
- change models so that functions are part of the schema, and so I can create a instance of a model (look at how LocalStrategy was set up)
- find out how to chain functions -> something.something.something -> follow mongoose of find.sort.skip.exec and exec be the last

All 

Done

Pending
