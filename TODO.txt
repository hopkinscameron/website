Future
- Create an admin page to add a new project (sub Portfolio)
- Ability to updload images for projects and blogs

All
- 1. Seperate out neccessary api calls (title, blog list, etc.) -> do in header as well so that certain things have it;s own api call on the page
- 2. see if I have to stringify the data or if I can just do res.json instead
- 3. move json data files under server under the module (fix routes)
- 4. move the models into its folders
- 5. remove formatting from short description on blog
- 6. blog views get updated on the blog edit page -> fix it
- blog draft put and blog update (put) method takes a very long time
- seperate out admin views/regular views
- move passport to config, seperate out express, app, etc.
- add middleware back to prevent sniffing and all that

- IE stuff not working
    - fancy font's not showing (could be proxy)
    - animation delays not delaying -> is animation delay on for IE (could be proxy)
    - font awesome icons not showing (could be proxy)
    - on search button, showing as an edit vs. a pointer (could be proxy issue)
    - tiny mce iconds don't appear (could be proxy)

MOBILE VIEW FIXES 
Sub Portfolio
    - there are some empty "col-md-2" for innerIndex in gameDataColumnsPerRowArray track by $index -> come back to this.. this exist on about page as well
