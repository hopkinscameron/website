Future
- Create an admin page to add a new project (sub Portfolio)
- Ability to updload images for projects and blogs
- Have an animation for loading the page (like discord does)

All 

Done


Pending
- 1. remove ctp.loading bar from all controllers
- 2. make sure each request get's logged to console again... it's not showing -> figure out where this is
- 4. move images/files to client locations -> make sure node creates a folder for this as well
- 5. create on client side in core, the config.js and init.js files
- 8. add layout.server.view.html to core
- 9. add social media to meta tags -> so add to config file
- 10. follow https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/production 

Next
- see if I can use lodash to speed up some stuff I might be doing in server stuff
- blog draft put and blog update (put) method takes a very long time
- seperate out admin views/regular views
- fix socket.io to not print so many error on disconnect


- IE stuff not working
    - fancy font's not showing (could be proxy)
    - animation delays not delaying -> is animation delay on for IE (could be proxy)
    - font awesome icons not showing (could be proxy)
    - on search button, showing as an edit vs. a pointer (could be proxy issue)
    - tiny mce iconds don't appear (could be proxy)

MOBILE VIEW FIXES 
Sub Portfolio
    - there are some empty "col-md-2" for innerIndex in gameDataColumnsPerRowArray track by $index -> come back to this.. this exist on about page as well
