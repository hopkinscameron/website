  "title": "About Me",
  "bio": "My passion for game design has existed since I first started playing video games in elementary school. My admiration for video games was much greater than it was for playing sports so I usually spent my free time inside instead of on a field or court. I had a strong desire to understand what it took to make video games. Having many experiences watching cartoons and playing a variety of games, I often found myself drawing new characters for those video games and cartoons, which is how I gained an interest in drawing art. After pursuing my passion, I was able to obtain my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Studio Art from The Ohio State University.<br/><br/>Currently, I am a Software Engineer at Nationwide Insurance in the downtown area of Columbus, OH. I work on and develop both internal and external software applications.",
