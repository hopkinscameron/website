        "overview": "<i>Road Rager</i> is a 2D top down racing game built using Unity3D. In this game, the player controls their choice of car and uses their skills to race through traffic without causing accidents. <br /> <br />The players game score increases based on the time they can survive racing. To help the user, there are assest the user can pick up, such as a shield and a fireball, that allows the user to use these pickups to their advantage. The fireball gives the user on shot to shoot a fireball at an enemy car to stop the car from crashing into the player, causing them to lose. The shield pickup allows the user to surround themself with a shield that protects them for a short length of time. If an enemy car comes in contact with the shield, the car is destroyed, and so it the shield, but the player is safe, for now.<br /> <br />Play on different difficulty levels to test your skills and see what high score you can achieve!",
